This project has two main files
*  main.py - Contains the main executable code.
*  features.py - This contains helper functions like to extract audio features.

The name of the dataset is GTZAN dataset and it can be downloaded from the given link (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification)

The data will be downloaded in zip form and contains multiple files. We'll be using only the audio files present in the extracted folder. 
So we just need the genres_original folder from the zip. Rename the folder "genres_original" to "genres" and put that folder in a separate folder with the two files mentioned above.

To see the working of code just run the ipynb file named main.ipynb.
